# JavaScript Calculator Project - README
## Introduction
This project is a simple on-screen calculator built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It consolidates the core concepts I've learned, such as functions, DOM manipulation, and event handling, into a functional, interactive application.

## What I Learned
### JavaScript
- Functions: Created add(), subtract(), multiply(), divide() and calculate() functions.
- DOM Manipulation: Updated the calculator's display and captured button clicks dynamically.
- Event Listeners: Made the calculator responsive to user interactions.
- State Management: Stored user input, operators, and results, managing them throughout operations.
### HTML & CSS
- HTML Structure: Built the interface with buttons for digits, operations, and actions.
- CSS Styling: Applied styles to make the calculator visually appealing and user-friendly.
### Problem Solving
- Edge Cases: Handled issues like division by zero and rounding long decimal results.
- Multiple Operations: Ensured the calculator only evaluates one operation at a time.
### Extra Features
- Decimal Input: Added support for floating-point numbers.
### Conclusion
This project brings together key concepts of front-end development, showcasing my ability to build a functional, interactive application from scratch. It strengthened my understanding of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, while also improving my problem-solving skills.
